          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned <br />
          were current, if not more so, in the company I <br />
          joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

          “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a <br />
          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experiencebhere. I signed up for <br />
          the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 <br /> 
          weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've <br />
          successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

            “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve <br />
            never written a line of code. I needed <br />
            some structure from professionals <br />
            who can help me learn programming <br />
             step by step. I was encouraged to <br />
             enroll by a former student of theirs <br />
             who can only say wonderful things <br />
             about the program. The entire <br />
             curriculum and staff did not <br />
             disappoint. They were very hands-on <br />
             and I never had to wait long for <br />
             assistance. The agile team project, in <br />
             particular, was outstanding. It took <br />
             my learning to the next level in a way <br />
             that no tutorial could ever have. In <br />
             fact, I’ve often referred to it during <br />
             interviews as an example of my <br />
             developent experience. It certainly <br />
             helped me land a job as a full-stack <br />
             developer after receiving multiple <br />
              offers. 100% recommend!  ”
